## Projects

### [parametric and nonparametric system identification](./parametric%20and%20nonparametric%20system%20identification)
This directory contains MATLAB code for system identification methods performed on simulated data, following methodologies from Lennart Ljung's *System Identification: Theory for the User*. The focus is on both **nonparametric** and **parametric** modeling techniques to estimate system characteristics from input-output data.
